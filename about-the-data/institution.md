# üè´ Institution

Institutions are organizations to which authors claim affiliations.

OpenAlex indexes about 109,000 institutions. The [Canonical External ID](./#canonical-external-ids) for institutions is the ROR ID. About 94% of institutions in OpenAlex have ROR IDs.

Our information about institutions comes from metadata found in Crossref, PubMed, ROR, MAG, and publisher websites. In order to link institutions to works, we parse every affiliation listed by every author. These affiliation strings can be quite messy, so we‚Äôve trained an algorithm to interpret them and extract the actual institutions with reasonably high reliability.

For a simple example: we will treat both ‚ÄúMIT, Boston, USA‚Äù and ‚ÄúMassachusetts Institute of Technology‚Äù as the same institution ([https://ror.org/042nb2s44](https://ror.org/042nb2s44)).

Institutions are linked to works via the [`works.authorships`](work.md#authorships) property.

{% hint style="info" %}
Many institution are missing one or more ID types (either because we don't know the ID, or because it was never assigned). Keys for null IDs are not displayed.

### `associated_institutions`

_List:_  `Institutions` related to this one. Each associated institution is represented as a [dehydrated Institution](institution.md#the-dehydratedinstitution-object) object, with one extra property:

* `relationship` (_String_): The type of relationship between this institution and the listed institution. Possible values: `parent`, `child`, and `related`.

Institution associations and the _relationship_ vocabulary come from [ROR's `relationships`](https://ror.readme.io/docs/ror-data-structure#relationships).

```json
associated_institutions: [
    {
        id: "https://openalex.org/I2802101240",
        ror: "https://ror.org/0483mr804",
        display_name: "Carolinas Medical Center",
        country_code: "US",
        type: "healthcare",
        relationship: "related"
    },
    {
        id: "https://openalex.org/I69048370",
        ror: "https://ror.org/01s91ey96",
        display_name: "Renaissance Computing Institute",
        country_code: "US",
        type: "education",
        relationship: "related"
    },
    
    // and so forth
]
```

### `counts_by_year`

_List:_ [`works_count`](institution.md#works\_count) and [`cited_by_count`](institution.md#cited\_by\_count) for each of the last ten years, binned by year. To put it another way: each year, you can see how many new works this venue started hosting, and how many times _any_ work in this venue got cited.

Years with zero citations and zero works have been removed so you will need to add those in if you need them.

```json
counts_by_year: [
    {
        year: 2022,
        works_count: 133,
        cited_by_count: 32731
    },
    {
        year: 2021,
        works_count: 12565,
        cited_by_count: 2180827
    },
    
    // and so forth
]
```



### `x_concepts`

{% hint style="danger" %}
The "x" in `x_concepts` is because it's experimental and subject to removal with very little warning. We plan to replace it with a custom link to the Concepts API endpoint.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

_List:_ The [`Concepts`](concept.md) most frequently applied to works affiliated with this institution. Each is represented as a [dehydrated Concept](concept.md#the-dehydratedconcept-object) object, with one additional attribute:

* `score` (_Float_): The strength of association between this institution and the listed concept, from 0-100.

```json
x_concepts: [
    {
        id: "https://openalex.org/C86803240",
        wikidata: null,
        display_name: "Biology",
        level: 0,
        score: 86.7
    },
    {
        id: "https://openalex.org/C185592680",
        wikidata: null,
        display_name: "Chemistry",
        level: 0,
        score: 51.4
    },
    
    // and so forth
]
```



### `works_api_url`

_String:_ A URL that will get you a list of all the [`Works`](work.md) affiliated with this institution.

We express this as an API URL (instead of just listing the `Works` themselves) because most institutions have way too many works to reasonably fit into a single return object.

```json
works_api_url: "https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=institutions.id:I114027177"
```

### `updated_date`

_String:_ The last time anything in this `Institution` changed, expressed as an [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_8601) date string. This date is updated for _any change at all_, including increases in various counts.

```json
updated_date: "2022-01-02T00:27:23.088909"
```

### `created_date`

_String:_ The date this `Institution` object was created in the OpenAlex dataset, expressed as an [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_8601) date string.&#x20;

```json
created_date: "2017-08-08"
```

## The `DehydratedInstitution` object

The `DehydratedInstitution` is stripped-down [`Institution`](institution.md#the-institution-object) object, with most of its properties removed to save weight. Its only remaining properties are:

* [`id`](institution.md#id)
* [`display_name`](institution.md#display\_name)
* [`ror`](institution.md#ror)
* [`country_code`](institution.md#country\_code)
* [`type`](institution.md#type)
